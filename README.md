## Features
- Faster process
- High Accurate Output Result.
- Best for Implementing on python based web application or APIs.
- Best implementation for College students and freshers for project creation.
- Ability to extract Aadhar and Pan numbers from given data.
- Applications are Images based attendance marking, similarity/difference detection, user verifications in financial institutions and other image-based platforms that want to implement image verification and measure changes in images.

## Installation

This library is compatible with both *windows* and *Linux system* you can just use **PIP command** to install this library on your system:

```shell
pip install face_recognition
pip install scikit-image
```

If you are facing any VS C++ 14 related issue in windows during installation, kindly refer to following solution: [Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44951456/pip-error-microsoft-visual-c-14-0-is-required "Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required")

## Requirements

###1) cv2 == 4.5.3

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.

##2) skimage == 0.18.3 

scikit-image (a.k.a. skimage ) is a collection of algorithms for image processing and computer vision.

###3) pytesseract ==0.3.8 

Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images.

###4) numpy == 1.19.5

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

###5) face_recognition ==1.2.3 

Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library. Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
